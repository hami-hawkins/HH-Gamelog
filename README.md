# My Gamelog

This is a fullstack application I developed as part of my studies at Dev Academy Aotearoa in 2024.

The purpose of this is to be able to keep track of any video games I am currently playing, and update the information as required. I have intentions of developing this into a larger app, however for now this will remain here as a proof of concept of what it is I hope to one day build.

## Features

- Log a game and all relevant information (Game, platform, completion, etc.)
- Update a game as complete
- Remove a game if it becomes abandoned

## Stretch

- Add games to a wishlist
- API calls to populate additional game data (game length, publisher, etc.)
